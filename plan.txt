Basic Project Roadmap for Auth, Web & Mobile, and Cloud Storage
A streamlined, four-sprint plan to build a minimal viable project featuring user authentication, web and mobile clients, and cloud-based document storage.

Phase 1: Setup & Design (Week 1)
Define core features

User sign-up / login

Document upload, listing, download

Web dashboard + mobile app

Choose technology stack

Initialize repositories & CI

Set up GitHub repo with main/dev branches

Configure basic CI (linting + tests)

Phase 2: Authentication Service (Week 2)
Design user model

Fields: email, password hash, created_at, last_login

Implement backend endpoints

POST /signup → create user + hash password

POST /login → verify credentials + issue JWT

GET /profile → protected route to fetch user info

Secure routes

Middleware to verify JWT on upload/download APIs

Integrate on clients

Web: store JWT in HTTP-only cookie or localStorage

Mobile: store in secure storage (Keychain / Keystore)

Phase 3: Cloud Storage Integration (Week 3)
Provision storage bucket

Create AWS S3 or GCS bucket

Configure permissions (bucket policy with restricted access)

Backend file APIs

GET /upload-url → generate pre-signed URL

GET /download/:id → validate JWT + fetch from bucket

DELETE /:id → remove from bucket & DB

Metadata persistence

Store file ID, original filename, URL, owner_id in database

Phase 4: Web & Mobile Clients (Weeks 4–5)
Web Dashboard
Login & Signup pages

File explorer view

List uploaded files with thumbnails or icons

Upload component

Drag-and-drop + progress bar

Download & Delete actions

Mobile App
Authentication screens (signup/login)

File list view

Upload via camera roll or document picker

Download and open in native viewer

Phase 5: Testing & Deployment (Week 6)
Write tests

Backend: unit tests for auth + storage APIs

Frontend: smoke tests for key UI flows

CI/CD pipeline

Automate build → test → deploy to staging

On merge to main, deploy to production environment

Deploy infrastructure

Use Terraform or CloudFormation for reproducible setup

Enable basic monitoring (CloudWatch / Google Cloud Monitoring)

Publish mobile app

Android: internal testing track on Google Play

iOS: TestFlight distribution

Next Steps & Enhancements
Add file sharing links with expiration

Implement role-based access control (e.g., view-only vs. edit)

Enable versioning and audit logs

Expand tests (load/performance) and add end-to-end suites

Explore CI integrations for automated mobile builds (Fastlane)
